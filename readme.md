# Knowledge Check - Bootstrap 5

This project demonstrates my understanding of Bootstrap utilities, forms, tables, images, and components in a small, focused website.

**A live version of the site can be found at *[Netlify](https://jtking-bootstrap.netlify.app/)***

The website uses HTML and Bootstrap 5 to create an example sign-up site to playtest an upcoming fictional video game for a fictional video game company. It includes

- Responsive Images
- Bootstrap Forms with Custom Validation
- Responsive Bootstrap Tables
- Buttons and Breakpoint Visibility
- Bootstrap Navigation Bars

The index.html is your starting point into the website. Other html files are at the same level. All other assets are grouped in the folder 'assets'.

If I were to re-visit this project I would spend some time on it's design. It currently is incredibly basic but with a little finesse could start to look like something. I'd like to practice more with images: image sizes and flex and grid are all a little difficult to navigate together. I would also love to be able to grab the submitted parameters and add them to the table live. That will be in the next project''
